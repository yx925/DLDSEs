name: DINGOS - Design of Innovative NCEs Generated by Optimization Strategies
description: Chemical creativity in the design of synthetic chemical entities (NCEs)
  with druglike properties has been the domain of medicinal chemists. Here, we explore
  the capability of a chemistry-savvy machine intelligence to generate synthetically
  accessible molecules. DINGOS (Design of Innovative NCEs Generated by Optimization
  Strategies) is a virtual assembly method that combines a rule-based approach with
  a machine learning model trained on successful synthetic routes described in chemical
  patent literature. This unique combination enables a balance between ligand-similarity
  based generation of innovative compounds by scaffold hopping and forward-synthetic
  feasibility of the designs. In a prospective proof-of-concept application, DINGOS
  successfully produced sets of de novo designs for four approved drugs that were
  in agreement with the desired structural and physicochemical properties. Target
  prediction indicated more than 50% of the designs as biologically active. Four selected
  computer-generated compounds were successfully synthesized in accordance with the
  synthetic route proposed by DINGOS. The results of this study demonstrate the capability
  of machine learning models to capture implicit chemical knowledge from chemical
  reaction data and suggest feasible syntheses of new chemical matter.
